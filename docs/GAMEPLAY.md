- **⛽ Fuel**: Depletes while moving. Refuel at fuel stations (bottom of level). Shows ⛽+ feedback when refueling.
- **❄️ Coverage**: Percentage of piste groomed. Reach target to win.
- **💪 Stamina**: Operator energy. Drains faster on steep slopes without winch, slower with winch. Below 30%, grooming width decreases. Visit Chez Marie to restore (shows 🍲 Tartiflette! on first visit, 💪 for top-ups).

## 🎯 Level Progression

### Saving Progress

Your progress is automatically saved when you complete a level. When you return to the game:
- **Resume**: Continue from where you left off
- **New Game**: Start fresh from the tutorial

### Difficulty Scaling

The game's difficulty naturally increases as you progress:

- **Obstacles**: Easier pistes (tutorial, green, blue) have fewer rocks and trees on the groomable area. Harder pistes (red, black) have more obstacles to navigate around.
- **Resort buildings**: Near-resort pistes feature Savoyard chalets with snow-covered roofs and smoking chimneys. Higher altitude pistes show only natural terrain.
- **Time pressure**: Later levels have tighter time limits relative to area size.
- **Steepness**: Advanced levels require winch operation on steep sections.

## 🎭 Characters

### Jean-Pierre 👨‍🔧
*Head Groomer*

Your mentor and the resort's most experienced operator. He's gruff but fair, and knows every contour of the mountain. Listen to his advice!

### Marie 👩‍🍳
*Restaurant Owner*

Runs "Chez Marie" at mid-station. Her tartiflette is legendary, and she always has a kind word for the night crew.

### Thierry 🧑‍⚕️
*Ski Patrol Chief*

Coordinates safety across the resort. When he says an area is dangerous, believe him. He'll brief you before hazardous missions.

### Émilie 📋
*Event Organizer*

Manages competitions and festivals. When she needs the park perfect for tomorrow's event, the pressure is on!

## 🎪 Special Events

Unlock special challenge missions as you progress:

- **Coupe des Aiguilles Blanches**: Slalom race preparation - perfect corduroy required!
- **Fête de la Tartiflette**: Festival week - heavy traffic, tight schedules
- **Boardercross Championship**: Park must be absolutely pristine
- **Nuit des Flambeaux**: Torchlight descent - deadline is sunset!
- **Raclette Emergency**: Clear a path for the cheese delivery truck! 🧀

## 💡 Advanced Tips

1. **Efficient patterns**: Work in long parallel strips rather than random movement
2. **Use terrain**: Let gravity help on downhill sections
3. **Plan fuel stops**: Route past the station when tank is at 30%
4. **Buff stacking**: Multiple food effects can be active simultaneously
5. **Winch wisely**: It uses more fuel but prevents dangerous sliding
6. **Weather awareness**: Storms reduce visibility and speed - prepare accordingly
7. **Use service roads**: On steep pistes, look for orange/black striped poles marking service roads - these safe routes let you reach winch anchors without the winch

## 🛣️ Service Roads

On advanced levels (Red and Black pistes), you'll find **service roads** marked with orange and black striped poles. These are switchback paths outside the main piste that allow your groomer to bypass steep sections.

**How to use:**
1. Look for the 🚜 Service Road sign at the piste edge
2. Drive between the striped marker poles
3. Follow the winding path uphill to reach winch anchors
4. Exit at the "To Piste" sign to rejoin the main run

**Why use them?**
- Steep zones (40°+) cause your groomer to tumble without a winch
- Service roads have gentle inclines safe for unassisted travel
- Use them to reach the first winch anchor, then use the winch for steeper sections

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Q: My groomer won't move!**
A: Check fuel level. If at 0%, find the nearest fuel station.

**Q: I keep running out of time!**
A: Focus on coverage, not perfection. 80% groomed is better than 50% perfect.

**Q: The winch won't work!**
A: Winch is only available on levels 4-8 where terrain requires it. You must be near a ⚓ anchor.

**Q: I can't reach the winch anchor!**
A: Look for service roads (orange/black poles) on the side of the piste. These provide safe access to anchors.

**Q: I can't see anything!**
A: Night levels have reduced visibility. Your headlights illuminate the path ahead.
